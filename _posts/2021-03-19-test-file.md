Mastering the React Hooks api will better help you use it in your work, and your mastery of React will take you to a higher level. This series will use a large number of example codes and effect demonstrations, which is very easy for beginners and reviewers to use.

In the last chapter, we learned useCallback to optimize performance. There is another hook api for performance optimization, which is useMemo. Let's take a look at an example.





## Counter example

It is still an example of a counter. Create 2 counters, and can distinguish whether the current is odd or even. In order to simulate a large amount of calculation logic affecting performance when the button is clicked, useless calculation logic is added to the method of judging even numbers, in order to make the performance worse The obvious. code show as below

Counter.tsx

``` jsx
import React, {useState} from'react'

function Counter() {
  const [counterOne, setCounterOne] = useState(0)
  const [counterTwo, setCounterTwo] = useState(0)

  const incrementOne = () => {
    setCounterOne(counterOne + 1)
  }

  const incrementTwo = () => {
    setCounterTwo(counterTwo + 1)
  }

  const isEven = () => {
    let i = 0
    while (i <1000000000) i += 1
    return counterOne% 2 === 0
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={incrementOne}
      >Count One = {counterOne}</button>
      <span>
        {
          isEven()?'even':'odd'
        }
      </span>
      <br />
      <button
        onClick={incrementTwo}
      >Count Two = {counterTwo}</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

App.tsx

``` jsx
import React from'react'
import'./App.css'

import Counter from'./components/27.Counter'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```

We found that clicking the first button has a longer delay because our logic for judging even numbers contains a lot of calculation logic. However, when we click the second button, there is also a longer delay! This is strange.

This is because every time the state is updated, the component will render and isEven will be executed, which is why we will get stuck when we click the second button. We need to optimize and tell React not to have unnecessary calculations, especially if this kind of calculation is complicated.

In our example, we want to tell React not to execute the isEven method when the second button is clicked. At this time, useMemo hook is needed.

## useMemo

### Optimization example

The usage is similar to useCallback.

``` js
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```
> Return a memoized value.
> Pass the "create" function and the dependency array as parameters to `useMemo`, it will only recalculate the memoized value when a dependency changes. This optimization helps avoid costly calculations every time you render.
>
> Remember, the function passed in `useMemo` will be executed during rendering. Please do not perform operations unrelated to rendering in this function. Operations such as side effects belong to the applicable scope of `useEffect`, not `useMemo`.
>
> If no dependency array is provided, `useMemo` will calculate a new value every time it is rendered.
>
> **You can use useMemo as a means of performance optimization, but don't use it as a semantic guarantee. ** In the future, React may choose to "forget" some of the previous memoized values ​​and recalculate them in the next rendering, such as freeing memory for off-screen components. First write code that can be executed without useMemo-then add useMemo to your code to optimize performance.

First introduce useMemo

``` js
import React, {useState, useMemo} from'react'
```

Then rewrite the isEven method with useMemo, and assign the return value to isEven

``` js
const isEven = useMemo(() => {
  let i = 0
  while (i <1000000000) i += 1
  return counterOne% 2 === 0
}, [counterOne])
```

Finally, remember to modify the place used by isEven, which has changed from a method to a variable

``` js
{
  isEven?'even':'odd'
}
```

The complete code is as follows

Counter.tsx

``` jsx
import React, {useState, useMemo} from'react'

function Counter() {
  const [counterOne, setCounterOne] = useState(0)
  const [counterTwo, setCounterTwo] = useState(0)

  const incrementOne = () => {
    setCounterOne(counterOne + 1)
  }

  const incrementTwo = () => {
    setCounterTwo(counterTwo + 1)
  }

  const isEven = useMemo(() => {
    let i = 0
    while (i <1000000000) i += 1
    return counterOne% 2 === 0
  }, [counterOne])

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        onClick={incrementOne}
      >Count One = {counterOne}</button>
      <span>
        {
          isEven?'even':'odd'
        }
      </span>
      <br />
      <button
        onClick={incrementTwo}
      >Count Two = {counterTwo}</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Counter
```

The effect is as follows

We see that when the second button is clicked, there will be no lag. This is because useMemo only relies on the counterOne variable. When the second button is clicked, isEven reads the cached value, and there is no need to recalculate whether Is an even number.

### The difference between useMemo and useCallback

useCallback caches the function itself, and useMemo caches the return value of the function.

## Summary

This chapter demonstrates the role of useMemo in performance optimization through examples. By caching the return value of the function, unnecessary calls are avoided, thereby avoiding component renderers.

Finally, the difference between useMemo and useCallback is analyzed, that is, useMemo caches the return value of the function, and useCallback caches the function itself. Both of these APIs are performance optimization methods.
